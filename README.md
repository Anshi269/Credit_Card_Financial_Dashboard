# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard
Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to create an interactive financial dashboard using Power BI that provides real-time insights into credit card transactions and customer behavior. By leveraging transaction and customer data from SQL tables, the dashboard aims to enable users to monitor, analyze, and visualize key metrics dynamically.
Steps Taken:
1) Data Integration and Import:
    Data Sources: Two SQL tables containing transaction details and customer information.
    Connection Setup: Establishing a connection to the SQL database from Power BI to import data.
    Import Method: Using direct query or data import to ensure real-time or near real-time data updates.
2)Data Transformation and Modeling:
   Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensuring data integrity and consistency through transformation steps (e.g., handling null values, data type conversion).
   Data Modeling: Building relationships between transaction and customer tables based on common keys (e.g., customer Number).
3)Dashboard Design and Development:
   Visualization Creation: Designing interactive visualizations such as charts (e.g., line charts, bar charts), graphs, and tables.
   Dynamic Filters and Slicers: Implementing slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities to enable users to explore data based on various dimensions (e.g., 
                                customer gender, week start date, card type).
   Real-Time Updates: Configuring the dashboard to update automatically as new data is added to the SQL tables.
Benefits:
Real-Time Decision Making: Provides up-to-date insights for timely decision-making based on current transaction and customer data.
Enhanced Visualization: Interactive visualizations facilitate deeper exploration and understanding of financial data.
Scalability: Can scale to accommodate additional data sources or expand functionality as needed.
Conclusion:
The real-time credit card financial dashboard developed using Power BI enables stakeholders to gain actionable insights into transactional activities and customer behavior instantly. It supports strategic decision-making by presenting critical financial metrics and trends in an intuitive and interactive manner.
